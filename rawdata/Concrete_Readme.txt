Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset

Data Type: Multivariate

Abstract:

Concrete is a pivotal material in civil engineering. The compressive strength of concrete, a highly nonlinear attribute, depends significantly on its age and composition, including cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
