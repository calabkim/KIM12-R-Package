#' Yacht Hydrodynamics Dataset for Package
#'
#' This curated dataset encompasses 100 observations tailored for hydrodynamic performance analysis in yacht design. It incorporates six explanatory variables alongside a response variable, the Residuary Resistance per Unit Weight of Displacement (RRPUWOD), which serves as a critical metric in evaluating yacht performance. The dataset facilitates the exploration of how various design parameters impact the hydrodynamic efficiency of yachts.
