# KIM12-R PACKAGE

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and data sets for analyzing various datasets using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) method. The files included are used to demonstrate different statistical and predictive modeling techniques.

## Contents
- `anova.mars.R`: Script for performing ANOVA analysis using the MARS method.
- `data-concrete.R`: Dataset and analysis script for predicting concrete strength.
- `data-fishToxicity.R`: Dataset and analysis script for evaluating fish toxicity.
- `data-testmars.R`: Script for testing MARS models on test data.
- `data-yacht.R`: Dataset and analysis script for predicting yacht hydrodynamics.
- `mars.R`: Main script implementing the MARS algorithm.
- `plot.mars.R`: Script for plotting results from MARS models.
- `predict.mars.R`: Script for making predictions using trained MARS models.
- `print.mars.R`: Script for printing MARS model summaries.
- `summary.mars.R`: Script for summarizing MARS model results.

## Setup
To use these scripts, you need to have R installed on your machine. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Installing Required Packages
Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```R
install.packages("earth")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
# Add any other packages used in your scripts

#  Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd yourrepository

3. Run the desired R script:

Rscript scriptname.R

For example, to run the MARS algorithm on the concrete dataset, use:

Rscript data-concrete.R
